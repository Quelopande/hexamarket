## Issues (Why you should not use it)
- XSS vulnerabilities: The output is not managed correctly.
- CSRF vulnerability: The code doesn't check if the user has sent the form in purpose.
- The code structure isn't Front Controller: This can lead to some data breaches and information to be in public html.
- Some information is stored in the public_html folder, this is bad because the user's private information could be leaked.
- There's a folder called mails that sends a email with outcheking anything, this can lead to email spamming and some crashes.
- Optimization error: When a user is signs up, the code creates a custom page for the user using a template. This isn't good because creating pages for each user or post would fill the memory space.
- The code uses from libraries and functions from other PHP versions, the code could not run correctly.
